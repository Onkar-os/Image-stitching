    <p>
        An Image Stitching System is a process used to combine multiple images into a single, high-quality panoramic or wide-angle image. This technique is widely used in fields such as photography, computer vision, and robotics. The process involves aligning overlapping images and seamlessly merging them to create a cohesive and wide view.

        The system typically works by detecting key feature points in each image, such as edges, corners, or distinctive patterns, and then matching these points across the images. After aligning the images based on these feature matches, the overlapping areas are blended to reduce visible seams, resulting in a smooth and natural-looking final image.

Developing an Image Stitching System involves a combination of advanced image processing techniques and robust software development practices. The project begins with understanding the requirements, such as the type of images to be stitched, the desired output quality, and the specific use case (e.g., panoramic photography, virtual reality, or medical imaging). The core of the system relies on algorithms for feature detection, image alignment, and seamless blending. Tools like OpenCV and machine learning frameworks are often used to implement these processes efficiently.

                <p>

                    The development process includes designing modules for preprocessing (to correct distortions or enhance image quality), feature extraction (using algorithms like SIFT, ORB, or SURF), and image registration to align overlapping regions. Once aligned, the blending process minimizes visible seams and adjusts for differences in lighting or exposure to produce a high-quality stitched image.
